# CarParkJS

Example NodeJS/JavaScript (ES2018) project with classes and Jest-tests. The frontend is written in pure JavaScript.

The application has a JavaScript-based server backend included in this repo, and additionally a Java-based server [here](https://github.com/dervism/carpark-provider).

### Requirments:

- Node / NPM (v. 10 or newer)
- Git

You can install these with HomeBrew (https://brew.sh/):

`brew install npm` and
`brew install git`

If you want to test run the automatic accessibility tests, then you also need `ChromeDriver`:

`brew install chromedriver`

### Setup:

```
$ git checkout https://github.com/dervism/carparkjs.git
$ cd carparkjs
$ npm install
```

### Running the application without frontend:

Run the command in a terminal or command window to start a simulation of a parking house:

```
$ npm run start-cli
```

will output:

```
